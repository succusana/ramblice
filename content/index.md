# Ramblice: Alice, But Ramblier

Hello! I'm Alice, and I have an actual site now! (Even if it's still under construction.)

This site/blog/whatevertheheck is mainly just a place for me to ramble about whatever I feel like, so get used to that. Said rambling will mostly be about whatever interests me: Tech stuff, games stuff, worldbuilding/creative writing stuff and anything else that might come to mind.

## Posts and stuff

You can find a list of the posts I've made to this blog [here](Posts/index).
