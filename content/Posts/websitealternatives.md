Recently, the announcement of changes to Twitter's (well, X's, but I'm going to call it Twitter because yes) block feature that make blocked users completely able to view your profile and posts have caused a bit of a mass exodus, particularly to a little platform called Bluesky: A "federated" social media website that is generally marketed as a Twitter alternative. For my own reasons, I have found myself leaving as well, and so far it's not been too bad! However, this transition got me thinking: Hasn't this happened many times before? Indeed, many websites have gone through similar incidents and ended up at a point where a subset of users decides to completely jump ship, and some of them even lasted longer than a week before coming back. Why don't we look at a few examples and see if there's any similarities?

## 1. The Reddit Blackout and Its Awkward Offspring

Examples of people trying to pack up and leave a website for a similar alternative go as far back as the creation of the first forums, but a fairly prominent example (and the first example I was directly present for) occurred on Reddit in 2015. and 2016. and 2017. and 2023. Most of these were for fairly horrific reasons that we'll get into, but for now let's focus on the two that *weren't* related to hatred.

The year is 2015, and Reddit is doing pretty well for itself as a hub for just about anything in nerd culture, with a subreddit existing for pretty much any interest, both for the better and *absolutely* for the worse. However, the site would soon find itself in a rather interesting situation when popular administrator and Reddit's Director of Talent Victoria Palmer was suddenly fired in July, immediately leaving the site's prominent AMAs (Ask Me Anything, essentially Q&As set up with celebrities and important people in their respective niches) without anyone to manage them. Inside of a few days, numerous subreddits completely locked themselves down in protest of her sudden firing, beginning the Reddit Blackout of 2015. 

It's important to note that this wasn't the *whole* reason and more just the spark that set off the cellar full of gunpowder Reddit had built its castle on top of. Essentially ever since Reddit has existed, its admins and moderators (the employees of Reddit and those who create and manage the site's numerous subreddits respectively) have always had a relationship that could be described as strained at best, with Reddit staff seemingly doing everything they can to get in the way of their users. From implementing controversial changes to the site to refusing to give moderators the support they need, It's no wonder that a lot of moderators felt like enough was enough and decided to take action. 

This is where our first challenger enters the story: Voat.co. Originally created in 2014 as Whoaverse, the site saw little popularity until 2015, when users who were tired of Reddit and their policies started leaving the platform in droves, *especially* during the blackout. It's no surprise that they did, because Voat's design is very similar to Reddit in a lot of ways...

Thanks to it being practically a carbon copy of Reddit's layout with a few visual tweaks and a big helping of the Find and Replace tool, the site recieved a huge influx of traffic from redditors, to the point of [taking the site offline numerous times over the coming days and weeks](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33447512). Eventually, the torrent settled down, and Voat was able to develop its own community of dedicated users. There was just one slight problem... 

They were *all* nazis.

### Turns Out Moderation Is Important Actually

As it turned out, Reddit was technically having an exodus for *two* reasons at the time, rather than just one. In its past, the site had been incredibly lax on sitewide moderation, leaving everything to the subreddit moderators, which almost instantly resulted in Reddit becoming the home for not just every cultural interest, but also every single crime and taboo one can think of: Piracy, shoplifting, every single drug known to humankind, gore, political conspiracy, harassment campaigns and even *outright child pornography* were all either allowed to grow to huge popularity without any admin intervention or were even outright promoted on r/all, the site's equivalent to a front page at the time. It took until 2015 for the staff to finally do something about a lot of these communities, striking r/fatpeoplehate (yes, seriously, that was a thing and it had over *150,000* members) [off of the website along with a few other harassment-focused subreddits.](https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/reddit-bans-communities-including-fat-people-hate-as-users-say-antiharassment-policies-could-be-beginning-of-the-end-10312251.html) Naturally, this angered the users of said subreddits, who would very much like a new place to continue their fun hobby of telling anyone with a BMI over 22 to jump off a bridge. How lucky for them that Voat had showed up as a Reddit clone which openly advertised itself as being censorship free!

Thanks to its oath to never censor its users, even touting its benefit of being in Switzerland for the country's strong privacy laws, Voat became *incredibly* popular with these Reddit exiles, who were later joined by the conspiracy theorists of subreddits such as r/pizzagate and various QAnon communities after their subreddits were also banned, as well as the definitely well adjusted members of r/incels. It wasn't long before Voat's lax policies and open welcoming of pretty much everybody onto the site had led to it developing a strong reputation for alt-right politics, racism, anti-semitism and pretty much every form of hatred under the sun. Truly, the reddit alternative we all needed.

Voat's history as the greatest [nazi bar](https://x.com/IamRageSparkle/status/1280892535024619522) the world had seen since 4chan got famous wasn't meant to last however. In 2020, after numerous issues including having to swap hosting provider in late 2015 and having to cooperate with US authorities in 2019 thanks to numerous threats posted on the website, the site would finally close its doors. Surprisingly, this *wasn't* because of Voat resembling the 7th circle of hell by that point, but for a far more mundane reason: [They just ran out of money](https://archive.is/0kOST). Granted, considering it takes less than a minute of scrolling to find someone blaming jews for all this, it's safe to say that they got off easy.

Overall, it's pretty clear that Voat did a pretty terrible job of being a Reddit alternative. Doing nothing to differentiate itself from Reddit aside from the feature that turned it into a hateful hellhole, it wasn't missed by the time it was gone. Later alternatives would still come along later (namely in the fediverse, which is a rabbit hole we'll get into soon) , but would generally never get anywhere near the amount of popularity or press that Voat once had.

## 2. Fandom: The Site That Launched a Thousand Alternatives

Now that we've talked about an absolute dumpster fire of an alternative, let's talk about an example that turned out a lot better... Although that isn't too hard. I don't think we could possibly get any *worse.*

Fandom was launched as Wikicities in 2004 (later changing name to Wikia, its most well known name) by Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, and was originally actually pretty good. The proposal back then was simple: Wikia let users easily make their own wikis for their own purposes, which would be hosted by Wikia and supported via ads. Naturally, users *flooded* into Wikia, soon making a wiki for just about every single thing that has ever existed and putting tons of information on them about even the most obscure details and hidden secrets of whatever they were interested in. This ushered in a golden age of information for any nerd curious enough to look, being able to find details about anything in a game, series or franchise they were interested in no matter how obscure, and even being able to add extra info themselves with ease. Of course, Wikia and Wikipedia did have one key difference: Rather than being a nonprofit foundation like the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikimedia_Foundation), Wikia was fully for profit, and they were going to make sure their userbase damn well knew it inside of a few years.

By the late 2010s and early 2020s, Wikia, now renamed Fandom, had been busy, and you could *tell*. Wikis on the website had gone from looking like this:

To this horrific mess:

Aside from losing a good 60% of the screen to ads and fluff, Fandom had gotten worse for those creating wikis too. The site had changed direction, going from its original motive of hosting wiki content to trying to thrive off of editorial content; Think like IGN, except infinitely worse, leading to autoplaying videos being thrown over just about every wiki page, outdated software that became a nightmare to use and even a whole host of security issues that Fandom just *didn't fix*. If you're curious how bad the situation was, this post by [the Runescape Wiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20190311174121/https://runescape.fandom.com/wiki/Forum:Leaving_Wikia) goes into pretty good detail about why the situation was somehow even worse than I'm making it sound here.

Thankfully, many alternatives exist! Because the underlying technology behind both Wikipedia and Fandom was open for anyone to use, *many* Fandom competitors have popped up over the years, with many wikis such as the [Super Mario Wiki](https://www.mariowiki.com/) just hosting their own independent sites, and others using alternatives to Fandom's free hosting like [Fextralife](https://fextralife.com/) and even Curse's Gamerpedia before Curse was bought by Amazon, torn apart and sold off to Fandom and Overwolf in scraps. Most notably for our story is [Wiki.gg](https://www.wiki.gg/), an alternative founded by indie.io in 2022 that has become sort of an underdog competitor in the last few years. And by that, I *mean* underdog: unlike Fandom, they don't extend their brand outside of an easily ignored top banner that hosts the create account and sign in buttons. Unfortunately, if you go search for a wiki that's on wiki.gg (like the Terraria wiki for example, which was formed after Re-Logic partnered with wiki.gg), you may find something odd...

It's *second*, despite being *the* official wiki. Fandom still holds an iron grip on SEO (Search Engine Optimisation), guaranteeing them priority for just about any wiki-related search result. This is rather unfortunate, both because of the fact it suppresses the better quality official material, but also for one reason we haven't gotten onto yet...

### We Didn't Start The Fire (But We'll Gladly Bring The Fuel)

Fandom's most obvious problem will be found by just about anyone who stumbles upon a fandom wiki while knowing anything about what they're researching: The site is *rife* with vandalism, misinformation or people just outright making stuff up.
